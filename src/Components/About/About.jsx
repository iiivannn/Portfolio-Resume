          <h2>Get to know me!</h2>
          <p>
            I started my web development journey on frontend web development. On
            my free time, I study new technology to keep up with the current
            technology being used.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, my interest in online courses propelled me even further
            in terms of my growth as a programmer and a developer. On February
            6, 2023, I finished my online course with freeCodeCamp on the
            course, Responsive Web Design. I gained enough knowledge to create
            basic websites and style them according to my end goal. Another
            online course that I have finished was CS50. Overall, the online
            course I attended were very helpful in being an educational material
            to learn sufficient web developer knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am very much open to learn new things may it be regarding on
            frontend or backend web development. I believe that we will be
            always a learner; learning new things for the better.
